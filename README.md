Presenters: **conf1ck3r** and **Elio Grieco**

Looking for a way to break into the world of AI agents without getting overwhelmed? This hands-on session aims to teach you how to build your own AI agents from scratch using the OpenAI API and Python. The workshop emphasizes practical skills and is geared towards beginners to guide you in API usage, scripting, and web interfaces to help you boost your productivity.

Throughout the workshop, you'll build a local chatbot, craft a web application for analyzing exploit code, and develop a script that interacts with the Malware Bazaar API to gather intelligence and create informative presentations. By the end, you'll have hands-on experience in applying these skills to real-world scenarios and a solid understanding of OpenAI API and Python scripting. This workshop is an ideal starting point for industry beginners, especially Windows users, providing the foundational knowledge needed to embark on a journey in AI agent development with clarity and confidence.

## Advice

The sheer amount and pace of research in this field is astounding. Keeping up with even 10% of what is released every week is nearly impossible, even for those working in the field.

Given this pace, it's important to take a pragmatic, and goal focused approach to learning about AI. Decide what you would like to accomplish, and focus your research toward that goal.
