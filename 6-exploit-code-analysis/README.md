# Exploit Code Analyzer and SNORT Rule Generator

## Overview

This Python script is designed to analyze exploit code and generate SNORT rules for detecting similar exploits. It utilizes the OpenAI GPT-4 model for generating the SNORT rules based on the input exploit code.

## Dependencies

- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch code from a provided URL.
- `openai`: The OpenAI Python client library, required for interacting with the OpenAI API.

## Functionality

1. **Fetching Exploit Code**:
    - The function `fetch_code_from_url` takes a URL as input.
    - It uses the `requests` library to fetch the content from the URL.
    - The function handles HTTP errors and other exceptions, returning appropriate error messages.

2. **Generating SNORT Rule**:
    - The function `generate_snort_rule` takes the fetched code as input.
    - It initializes the OpenAI API with a key (to be provided by the user).
    - A prompt is created asking the AI to analyze the exploit code and suggest a SNORT rule.
    - The OpenAI GPT-4 model is queried with this prompt.
    - The function handles any exceptions during this API call and returns the generated SNORT rule or an error message.

3. **Main Workflow**:
    - The script starts by asking the user to input a URL pointing to exploit code.
    - It then fetches the code from the URL and, if successful, proceeds to analyze the code using the `generate_snort_rule` function.
    - The script outputs the suggested SNORT rule or an error message if the process fails at any point.

## Usage

1. Install the required `requests` and `openai` Python libraries.
2. In the `env.example` file, replace `<REPLACE_WITH_OPENAI_API_KEY>` with your actual OpenAI API key.
3. Copy `env.example` to `.env`.
4. Run the script, and when prompted, enter the URL of the exploit code you wish to analyze.
5. The script will fetch the code, analyze it, and print out the suggested SNORT rule.

## Example

- User inputs the URL of a known exploit code.
- The script fetches the code, analyzes it, and outputs a SNORT rule tailored to detect similar exploits.

## Note

- This script is intended as a tool for cybersecurity professionals and researchers.
- The accuracy and effectiveness of the generated SNORT rules depend on the input code and the capabilities of the OpenAI GPT-4 model.
- Always review and test generated SNORT rules before deploying them in a production environment.
