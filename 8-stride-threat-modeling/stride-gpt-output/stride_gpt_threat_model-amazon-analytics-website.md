## Threat Model

| Threat Type | Scenario | Potential Impact |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Spoofing | An attacker could spoof a legitimate user's authentication session by exploiting weaknesses in the basic authentication method, especially if the application does not enforce strong password policies or use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. | Unauthorized access to a user's account, leading to unauthorized viewing or manipulation of sensitive pricing and inventory data. |
| Tampering | An attacker could tamper with the CSV or Excel files being uploaded by injecting malicious code into them. Since the application processes these files, the code could be executed on the server, leading to data manipulation or loss. | Compromise of server integrity, unauthorized data alteration, and potential server takeover. |
| Repudiation | Without proper logging and monitoring of user actions, it becomes difficult to track who did what within the application. An authorized user could maliciously modify pricing or inventory and deny such actions. | Lack of accountability and difficulty in auditing user actions can lead to compromised data integrity and trust issues among users. |
| Information Disclosure | The application's lack of privileged access management means that any user, once authenticated, might access or leak sensitive product lists, pricing, and inventory information not intended for them. | Unauthorized access to sensitive information that could be used for competitive advantage or malicious intent. |
| Denial of Service | Attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the Ruby on Rails backend or the frontend JavaScript to initiate a DOS attack, overwhelming the application with a flood of traffic. | Such an attack could render the application unavailable to legitimate users, disrupting their ability to manage pricing and inventory effectively. |
| Elevation of Privilege | Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application, especially given its lack of privileged access management, an attacker could gain unauthorized privileges, allowing them to execute commands, alter data, or create privileged accounts. | This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functionality and data, allowing for widespread data manipulation or theft. |


## Improvement Suggestions

- Implement multi-factor authentication to strengthen user authentication.
- Employ HTTPS to secure data in transit and ensure communication between the client and server is encrypted.
- Introduce input sanitization and validation to mitigate the risk of uploading malicious files.
- Implement privileged access management to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality based on user roles.
- Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to ensure all user activities are tracked and auditable.
- Conduct regular security assessments and vulnerability scanning to identify and remediate potential security weaknesses.
