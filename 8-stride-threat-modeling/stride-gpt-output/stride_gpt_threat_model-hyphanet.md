## Threat Model

| Threat Type | Scenario | Potential Impact |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Spoofing | An attacker could imitate a legitimate Hyphanet node, deceiving users into connecting to a malicious node instead. This could happen if the attacker manages to bypass the cryptographic verification in DarkNet mode or if users are not careful when verifying nodes. | Sensitive unclassified data could be intercepted, and users could be directed to crafted malicious Free Sites designed for phishing or malware distribution. |
| Tampering | Given that the application relies on a distributed protocol written in Java, an attacker could potentially introduce malicious code into the protocol daemon or proxy software, especially if the software distribution channels are compromised. | Malicious actions could be performed on behalf of the user, from altering transmitted data to corrupting files exchanged through the network. |
| Repudiation | Without any form of authentication and privileged access management, it would be difficult to attribute actions or changes within the Hyphanet network to any specific user, allowing malicious users to deny any wrongdoing. | An attack could lead to distribution of illegitimate content or denial of service, without a clear way to identify or prove the source of the malicious activity. |
| Information Disclosure | An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the distributed protocol or Java code to gain unauthorized access to unclassified sensitive data being transmitted over Hyphanet. | This could lead to a breach of user privacy, exposure of sensitive data, and loss of trust in the Hyphanet platform. |
| Denial of Service | Attackers might flood the network with an excessive amount of data or specially crafted packets, aiming to overload the system despite the mitigations against timing attacks and TTL triangulation, especially in OpenNet mode where connections can be made freely. | Such an attack could render the Hyphanet services unavailable, denying access to users and potentially disrupting communication or file exchange. |
| Elevation of Privilege | Exploiting potential vulnerabilities in the Java implementation of the protocol daemon or proxy might allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine, especially if running with higher privileges. | This could lead to complete control over the affected systems, enabling the attacker to perform malicious actions such as data theft, installation of malware, or further propagation within the network. |


## Improvement Suggestions

- Implement user authentication methods to help track and restrict actions within Hyphanet.
- Consider adopting a more secure, regularly updated programming language or security practices for the protocol daemon and proxy development.
- Enhance the application's integrity verification mechanism during software update or node verification process.
- Introduce a thorough security audit and penetration testing phase before major releases to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Consider implementing rate limiting or additional mitigations against Denial of Service attacks.
- Provide a clear, user-friendly guide on how to safely operate within the Hyphanet, including tips on how to avoid phishing and other common cyber threats.
